# Aurelia MDC scaffolding skeleton

The scaffolding repo for Aurelia MDC used by the [makes](https://makes.js.org) tool to create new Aurelia MDC projects.

## Create an Aurelia MDC project

First, ensure that you have Node.js v14 or above installed on your system. Next, using [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b), a tool distributed as part of Node.js, we'll create a new Aurelia MDC app. At a command prompt, run the following command:

```bash
npx makes aurelia-mdc-web
```

This will cause `npx` to download the `makes` tool, along with the `aurelia-mdc-web` scaffold from this repo, which it will use to guide you through creating your project.
